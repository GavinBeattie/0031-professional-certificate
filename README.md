## Structuring your GitHub repository
I'm using Visual Studio Code for editing and source control. This will initially be a public repository. I'm going to use this readme a bit like an accompanying log to start with and tidy up later as documentation.

My next step to try and include a Jupyter notebook. Done - I have added an intially dummy notebook and entered it into source control (quite painless, actually).

## To Do
It might be helpful to side edit notebooks between Jupyter and VS Code, I'll revisit this at the end if there's time.
